      <h1>2005 Revival</h1>
      <p>The new <strong>first series</strong> of British science fiction programme <em><strong><a href="../index.html">Doctor Who</a></strong></em> began on 26 March 2005 with the episode "Rose", which marked the end of the programme's 16-year absence from episodic television following its cancellation in 1989, and the first new televised <em>Doctor Who</em> story since the broadcast of the TV movie starring <a href="../the-doctors/actors/paul-mcgann.html">Paul McGann</a> in 1996. The finale episode, "The Parting of the Ways", was broadcast on 18 June 2005. The show was revived by longtime <em>Doctor Who</em> fan Russell T Davies, who had been lobbying the BBC since the late 90s to bring the show back. The first series comprised 13 episodes, eight of which Davies wrote. Davies, Julie Gardner and Mal Young served as executive producers, Phil Collinson as producer.</p>
      
      <p>The show depicts the adventures of a mysterious and eccentric Time Lord known as the Doctor, who travels through time and space in his time machine, the TARDIS, which normally appears from the exterior to be a blue 1950s British police box. With his companions, he explores time and space, faces a variety of foes and saves civilizations, helping people and righting wrongs. The first series features<a href="../the-doctors/actors/christopher-eccleston.html"> Christopher Eccleston </a>as the ninth incarnation of the Doctor, his only series as the Doctor, accompanied by <a href="../the-companions/actors/billie-piper.html">Billie Piper</a>, as his first and main companion <a href="../the-companions/characters/rose-tyler.html">Rose Tyler</a>, whom he plucks from obscurity on planet Earth, and to whom he grows increasingly attached. He also travels briefly with unruly boy-genius Adam Mitchell, played by Bruno Langley, and with 51st-century con man and former 'Time Agent' Captain <a href="../the-companions/characters/jack-harkness.html">Jack Harkness</a>, portrayed by <a href="../the-companions/actors/john-barownam.html">John Barrowman</a>. Episodes in series one form a loose story arc, based upon the recurring phrase "Bad Wolf", the significance of which goes unexplained until the two-part series finale.</p>
      <p>The series premiere was watched by 10.81 million viewers, and four days after the premiere aired, <em>Doctor Who</em> was renewed for a Christmas Special, as well as a second series. Series 1 was well received by both critics and fans, winning for the first time in <em>Doctor Who</em> '​s history a prestigious BAFTA Award. Most surprising was the approval from Michael Grade, who had previously forced an 18-month hiatus on the show in 1985, and had postponed <em>Doctor Who</em> out of personal dislike on several occasions. The show's popularity ultimately led to a resurgence in family-oriented Saturday night drama.    </p>
