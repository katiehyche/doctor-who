Extending his repertoire into&nbsp;West End theatre, he has since performed in the stage adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Swimming with Sharks</em>&nbsp;with&nbsp;Christian Slater,[4]&nbsp;followed a year later by a critically acclaimed performance as Henry in&nbsp;<em>That Face</em>.[5]</p>
      <p>Before his role in&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>, Smith's first television role came in 2006 as&nbsp;Jim Taylor&nbsp;in the BBC adaptations ofPhilip Pullman's&nbsp;<em>The Ruby in the Smoke</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Shadow in the North</em>&nbsp;while his first major role in television came as Danny in the 2007 BBC series&nbsp;<em>Party Animals</em>. Smith, who was announced as the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor in January 2009, is the youngest person to play the character in the British television series.[6]&nbsp;He left the series at the end of the 2013 Christmas Day special, "The Time of the Doctor".[7]&nbsp;He will play a major role in upcoming movie&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Genisys</em>&nbsp;and its two sequels.[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.
