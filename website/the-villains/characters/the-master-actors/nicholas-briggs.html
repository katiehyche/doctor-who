      <h1>Nicholas Briggs</h1>
      <p dir="ltr">Nicholas Briggs (born 29 September 1961), sometimes credited under the pseudonyms David Sax orArthur Wallis, wrote, directed and performed in various media. Most of all, he participated in many ways in the production of Big Finish audio stories as well as writing and performing in licenced spin-off videos for BBV Productions. In the revived series of <a href="../../../index.html">Doctor Who</a> as well as Big Finish Doctor Who, he voices <a href="../the-daleks.html">the Daleks</a>, <a href="../cyberman.html">Cybermen</a>, Ice Warriors and a variety of one-timealiens.</p>
      
      <p dir="ltr">Briggs has the distinction of being the only actor to have regular roles in the revived TV series for the BBC and Big Finish Productions (guest stars from the revival have appeared in the audios, but none of the other regulars appear in both, including <a href="../../../the-companions/actors/elisabeth-sladen.html">Elisabeth Sladen</a> who ended her Big Finish <a href="../../../the-companions/characters/sarah-jane-smith.html">Sarah Jane Smith</a> series when she began reprising the role on TV).</p>
      He also took part in The Weakest Link: Doctor Who Special but was voted out early on.
